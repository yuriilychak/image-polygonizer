# image-polygonizer
A browser-based polygonization tool for PNG/WebP assets: detect non-transparent regions, trace contours (e.g., marching squares), and simplify them into compact polygons (e.g., RDP) with configurable vertex budgets, and offsets. Built with React and WebAssembly for fast, interactive processing and export-ready results.
